# Label with a hosted teacher

The published labels came from Qwen3.8-27B (NVFP4 weights) on one RTX 5090. Without that GPU, a hosted API can be the teacher. This guide covers what to set so `gen-data` talks to a hosted API, a cheap option that was measured (DeepSeek V4.1 Flash on Ollama Cloud), who serves the published teacher model itself, and what relabeling the published run's 54,325 requests costs.

**Short version.** DeepSeek V4.1 Flash on Ollama Cloud labeled 22 real states with no failures, 455 input and 31 output tokens per request, and 0.6 s per request. At Ollama's list prices, 54,325 requests would cost about $4.73 off-peak or $9.46 at peak. It is not the model the published labels came from: it chose the published teacher's move on 21 of those 22 states, a sample far too small to call it equivalent. To reproduce the published labels as closely as possible, use a provider that serves Qwen3.8-27B (from about $7.39 for the same run).

Labeling is the only place a hosted model enters. The student trains and plays locally as in [distill.md](distill.md).

## What differs from a local server

Four things, all handled through `.env`:

1. **Key.** `TEACHER_API_KEY` is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Keep it out of the repository; `.env` is gitignored.
2. **Thinking.** Qwen3.8 and DeepSeek V4.1 Flash think by default. The teacher asks for thinking off with `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}`, which a local vLLM or SGLang server honors and hosted APIs ignore. With thinking left on, a hosted model spends its 200-token answer budget on hidden reasoning (on a two-word test prompt it used 105 reasoning tokens for a two-token answer), so answers come back truncated or not at all and cost several times more. Each provider has its own switch; put it in `TEACHER_EXTRA_BODY`, a JSON object merged into every request (see the table below). Check that the report's `reasoningTokens` is 0 after a short run.
3. **Rate limits.** Hosted APIs answer HTTP 429 when you exceed a limit. With `TEACHER_MAX_RETRIES` above 0, the teacher waits (honoring `Retry-After`, or "retry after N s" in the error text) and asks again instead of dropping the state. The default 0 keeps the old behavior: a failed request leaves the state unlabeled.
4. **Concurrency.** `gen-data` plays in lockstep, so one process has one request in flight. Concurrency is the number of processes you run. Run one process per seed range, or per seed, to fill the provider's limit.

`gen-data` now records each request's `label_input_tokens`, `label_output_tokens`, and, when the server reports it (OpenRouter and Vercel AI Gateway do, in `usage.cost`), `label_cost_usd`; the report sums them.

## Recommended cheap teacher: DeepSeek V4.1 Flash on Ollama Cloud

Ollama Cloud serves `deepseek-v4.1-flash` (a 763B-parameter mixture-of-experts model, FP8, per Ollama's model metadata) behind an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Billing is pay-as-you-go from usage credits: the Free plan includes starter credits, and Pro ($20 a month) and Max ($100 a month) include $60 and $300 of credits. List prices on 2026-10-05, per million tokens:

| | Input | Cached input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Peak (12:00-18:00 UTC on weekdays) | $0.30 | $0.006 | $1.20 |
| Off-peak (all other hours, and weekends) | $0.15 | $0.003 | $0.60 |

Max lists 10 concurrent requests; the pricing page states no concurrency number for Free or Pro. Sources: [Ollama pricing](https://ollama.com/pricing), the [model page](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-v4.1-flash), and Ollama's [cloud](https://docs.ollama.com/cloud) and [OpenAI compatibility](https://docs.ollama.com/api/openai-compatibility) docs.

```bash
TEACHER_BASE_URL=https://ollama.com/v1
TEACHER_MODEL=deepseek-v4.1-flash
TEACHER_API_KEY=<your ollama.com API key>
TEACHER_EXTRA_BODY={"reasoning_effort":"none"}
TEACHER_MAX_RETRIES=5
```

`{"reasoning_effort":"none"}` (or `{"reasoning":{"effort":"none"}}`) turns thinking off on this endpoint; `{"think":false}` did not. Ollama does not return a cost in `usage`, so `label_cost_usd` stays empty; compute cost from the recorded tokens and the price for the hour you ran in.

Measured numbers are under [Measured](#measured). The caveat stands throughout: a different teacher gives different labels, and a student trained on them is a new model to evaluate, not a reproduction of `pacman-0.8b-qwen`.

## Providers of Qwen3.8-27B

Serverless endpoints for Qwen3.8-27B, the model behind the published labels, as listed on 2026-10-05. Prices are USD per million tokens. "Per 1k requests" applies the measured average of 466.7 input and 35.2 output tokens per request (see [Measured](#measured)): (466.7 × input price + 35.2 × output price) / 1,000.

| Provider | Reached through | Input | Output | Per 1k requests | Weights | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DeepInfra | direct, OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway | 0.15 | 1.875 | $0.136 | bf16 | 200 concurrent requests per model by default; structured output; no logprobs listed on OpenRouter |
| Parasail | OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway | 0.24 | 2.20 | $0.189 | fp8 | logprobs and structured output |
| Chutes | OpenRouter | 0.24 | 2.20 | $0.189 | fp8 | |
| Alibaba Cloud Model Studio | direct | 0.424 (China, Beijing) / 0.50 (International) | 1.696 / 3.00 | $0.258 / $0.339 | official | the model's publisher; TPM limit tiered by monthly spend; logprobs |
| Alibaba | OpenRouter / Vercel AI Gateway | 0.425 / 0.50 | 2.55 / 3.00 | $0.288 / $0.339 | official | |
| Novita | OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway | 0.42 | 3.00 | $0.302 | not stated | logprobs |
| Groq | direct | 0.80 | 4.00 | $0.514 | Groq TruePoint | preview model; developer plan 250K tokens and 1K requests per minute; 131K context |
| Cerebras | OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway | 0.99 | 1.49 | $0.515 | fp16 | logprobs; 65K context on OpenRouter |

OpenRouter also lists smaller hosts with lower input prices: Darkbloom (fp4, 0.05 / 2.20, $0.101 per 1k requests), Ionstream (fp8, 0.089 / 2.35, $0.124), DekaLLM (0.049 / 3.00), Reka (0.05 / 3.00), and Wafer (0.024 / 4.35, $0.164). Their quantization and capacity are less documented. Check uptime on OpenRouter before you start a long run with one of them.

Not usable for this job on 2026-10-05: Together AI offers Qwen3.8-27B only for fine-tuning and dedicated inference, and Fireworks only as an on-demand deployment ("Serverless: Not supported"). OpenRouter's free variant `qwen/qwen3.8-27b:free` is capped at 50 requests a day (1,000 after buying $10 of credits). Vercel AI Gateway's free tier refuses Qwen3.8-27B ("Free tier users do not have access to this model") but serves Qwen3.6-27B.

Sources, read 2026-10-05: OpenRouter's endpoint list (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models/qwen/qwen3.8-27b/endpoints`), Vercel AI Gateway's (`https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/models/alibaba/qwen3.8-27b/endpoints`), the model pages of [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/qwen3-8-27b), [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/model/qwen/qwen3.8-27b), and [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/models/fireworks/qwen3p8-27b), [DeepInfra's rate limits](https://docs.deepinfra.com/account/rate-limits), and [OpenRouter's limits](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api_reference/limits). Prices change; recheck them before a run.

## Settings

Set the teacher in `.env` (gitignored). Take the key from your password manager or the provider's console; never commit it.

| Route | `TEACHER_BASE_URL` | `TEACHER_MODEL` | `TEACHER_EXTRA_BODY` (thinking off) |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenRouter | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` | `{"reasoning":{"effort":"none"}}` |
| Vercel AI Gateway | `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1` | `alibaba/qwen3.8-27b` | `{"reasoning":{"enabled":false}}` |
| Alibaba Cloud Model Studio | `https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` | `qwen3.8-27b` | `{"enable_thinking":false}` |
| Groq | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` | `{"reasoning_effort":"none"}` |
| Ollama Cloud (DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, not Qwen) | `https://ollama.com/v1` | `deepseek-v4.1-flash` | `{"reasoning_effort":"none"}` |

On Vercel AI Gateway, `{"reasoning":{"enabled":false}}`, `{"reasoning":{"effort":"none"}}`, and `{"reasoning_effort":"none"}` all gave 0 reasoning tokens on Qwen3.6-27B, and `chat_template_kwargs` alone did not. The Ollama Cloud switch was run here too. The OpenRouter, Alibaba, and Groq switches are from their documentation and were not run here.

An aggregator routes each request to any provider that serves the model unless you pin one. Pin the provider you priced, so the labels come from one set of weights, by adding to the same JSON:

- OpenRouter: `"provider":{"order":["deepinfra"],"allow_fallbacks":false}`
- Vercel AI Gateway: `"providerOptions":{"gateway":{"only":["deepinfra"]}}`

For example, DeepInfra through Vercel AI Gateway:

```bash
TEACHER_BASE_URL=https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1
TEACHER_MODEL=alibaba/qwen3.8-27b
TEACHER_API_KEY=<your gateway key>
TEACHER_EXTRA_BODY={"reasoning":{"enabled":false},"providerOptions":{"gateway":{"only":["deepinfra"]}}}
TEACHER_MAX_RETRIES=30
```

Then run the commands of [distill.md](distill.md#1-label-states) unchanged. Because each process has one request in flight, start more processes than the published run's eight to use a hosted provider's capacity, one per seed or per small seed range:

```bash
for seed in $(seq 2000 2029); do
  npm run gen-data -- --player greedy --labeler teacher-peek5s --games 1 --seed $seed --out data/q1/train > data/q1/logs/g$seed.log 2>&1 &
done
wait
```

The answer cache is per process, so splitting a seed range across processes sends a few more requests than the published run's 54,325 (repeated prompts within one game are still cached).

## Measure before you relabel

Try a provider on a sample before paying for the full set. `--label-every k` asks the teacher on every k-th decision only, while the player still plays every one, so the sample covers whole games:

```bash
npm run gen-data -- --player greedy --labeler teacher-peek5s --games 2 --seed 2000 --label-every 20 --out data/api/train
```

Then compare with labels you already have for the same players and seeds, and project the cost:

```bash
python3 scripts/compare_teacher_labels.py --new data/api/train --ref data/q1/train \
  --price deepinfra:0.15:1.875 --price alibaba-intl:0.50:3.00 --requests 54325
```

Players are deterministic for a seed, so the script joins the two runs on player, seed, and tick and checks that the encoded state and options are identical before comparing labels. It reports agreement (with a 95% interval), tokens, latency, errors, the cost the server reported, and the projection.

## Measured

Two small measurements on 2026-10-05 (Pacific time), both with the `teacher-peek5s` prompt of the published run (features encoding plus the 5-second rollout facts), temperature 0, thinking off, on training seeds. Neither model is the published teacher, and both samples are small: they establish tokens, cost, latency, and that the setup works, not label quality.

### DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, Ollama Cloud

One process (concurrency 1), `--player greedy --seed 2000 --games 1 --label-every 60`, so the 22 states are spread over the whole game. Run at 00:28 UTC on 2026-10-06, off-peak.

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Requests answered | 22 of 22 |
| Input tokens per request | 455.4 mean, 514 p90 |
| Output tokens per request | 31.3 mean, 35 p90 |
| Reasoning tokens | 0 |
| Latency per request | 0.60 s p50, 0.78 s p90 |
| Unparseable or illegal answers, HTTP errors | 0 |
| Cost of the run | 10,019 input and 688 output tokens: (10,019 × $0.15 + 688 × $0.60) / 10^6 = $0.0019 off-peak |
| Same choice as the published Qwen3.8-27B labels | 21 of 22 (95% interval 78-99%); tiny sample, a rough signal only |

### Qwen3.6-27B, Vercel AI Gateway (secondary)

No key with paid access to Qwen3.8-27B was available, so this measurement used `alibaba/qwen3.6-27b` through Vercel AI Gateway's free tier (served by Alibaba, $0.60 input and $3.60 output per million tokens), on a handful of states. Qwen3.6-27B is the previous release of the same 27B model line and is weaker than the Qwen3.8-27B teacher behind the published labels, so its labels are not equivalent, and its agreement with the published teacher was not measured at scale. The run was stopped early by decision: the token counts per state, which set the cost, were the point.

Setup: `teacher-peek5s` prompts (features encoding plus the 5-second rollout facts), thinking off with `{"reasoning":{"enabled":false}}`, temperature 0, `--label-every 20` on training seeds 1000-1001 (`oracle-5s`), 2000-2001 (`greedy`), and 3000-3004 (`random`), three processes, 2026-10-05.

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Requests answered | 66 (72 states labeled; 6 repeated prompts came from the cache) |
| Input tokens per request | 466.7 mean, 519 p90 |
| Output tokens per request | 35.2 mean, 41 p90 |
| Reasoning tokens | 0 |
| Reported cost | $0.026848 in total, $0.000407 per request |
| Latency per request | 2.0 s p50, 2.8 s p90 |
| Unparseable or illegal answers | 0 |
| Requests that hit the rate limit first | 30 of 66 (free tier: 5 requests per minute; all succeeded on retry) |
| Same choice as the published Qwen3.8-27B labels | 69 of 72 (95.8%; 95% interval 88-99%) |

The cost the gateway reported equals the list price applied to the token counts: (466.7 × $0.60 + 35.2 × $3.60) / 10^6 = $0.000407 per request. Input and output weigh about equally in the bill, so a provider's output price matters as much as its input price here.

Qwen3.6-27B and Qwen3.8-27B share the same `vocab.json` and `merges.txt` on Hugging Face, so a state costs the same number of tokens on either, give or take a few chat-template tokens.

The 72-state agreement says the prompt, the rollout facts, and the answer format carry over to a hosted model unchanged. It does not show that Qwen3.6-27B labels as well as Qwen3.8-27B: the sample is small, and two of the three differences were on `oracle-5s` states (7 of 9 agreed), the strong-play positions where a weaker teacher would show first.

### Projected for the published run

The published run sent 54,325 teacher requests. Cost = 54,325 × (input tokens × input price + output tokens × output price) / 10^6, with each model's measured tokens per request: 455.4 and 31.3 for DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, 466.7 and 35.2 for Qwen (Qwen3.6 and Qwen3.8 share a tokenizer). Cached-input discounts are ignored, so these are upper bounds where a provider caches the shared prompt prefix.

| Provider (Qwen3.8-27B unless noted) | Per 1k requests | 54,325 requests |
|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, Ollama Cloud, off-peak | 0.0683 + 0.0188 = $0.087 | $4.73 |
| DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, Ollama Cloud, peak | 0.1366 + 0.0376 = $0.174 | $9.46 |
| DeepInfra | 0.0700 + 0.0660 = $0.136 | $7.39 |
| Parasail | 0.1120 + 0.0774 = $0.189 | $10.29 |
| Alibaba Model Studio, China (Beijing) | 0.1979 + 0.0597 = $0.258 | $13.99 |
| Alibaba Model Studio, International (also via Vercel AI Gateway) | 0.2334 + 0.1056 = $0.339 | $18.41 |
| Groq | 0.3734 + 0.1408 = $0.514 | $27.93 |
| Cerebras | 0.4620 + 0.0524 = $0.515 | $27.95 |
| Qwen3.6-27B, Alibaba via Vercel AI Gateway (the one measured) | 0.2800 + 0.1267 = $0.407 | $22.10 |

Wall time depends on latency and on how many processes run, not on price. With P processes and latency L per request, the run takes about 54,325 × L / P, but never less than the longest single game: up to 1,276 requests in one game of the published run, asked one after another. Vercel AI Gateway's own latency figures for Qwen3.8-27B over the preceding hour were about 0.6-0.7 s p50 for DeepInfra, Parasail, Cerebras, and Novita, and 2.1 s for Alibaba, close to the 2.0 s measured here on Qwen3.6-27B. Except for the two latencies measured here, these are estimates:

| | L | P = 16 | P = 32 | One game, floor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, Ollama Cloud (measured) | 0.6 s | 34 min | 17 min | 13 min |
| DeepInfra-class latency | 0.7 s | 40 min | 20 min | 15 min |
| Alibaba latency (measured on 3.6) | 2.0 s | 113 min | 57 min | 43 min |

On Ollama Cloud, Max's 10 concurrent requests give 54,325 × 0.6 s / 10 = 54 minutes; at 2 concurrent requests the run takes about 4.5 hours. Groq's developer plan caps tokens at 250K per minute: at about 502 tokens per request that is about 500 requests per minute, so at least 109 minutes. The published run on the RTX 5090 took about 65 minutes at concurrency 8.

## Caveats

- The hosted teacher is not the published teacher. Same model name is not same numbers: the published labels came from NVFP4 weights on a 5090, and providers serve bf16, fp8, fp4, or unstated precision. Relabel a sample and compare (above) before trusting a provider's labels for a full run, and pin the provider.
- DeepSeek V4.1 Flash is a different model from the published teacher. 21 of 22 matching labels says the prompt and answer format work with it; it does not say its labels train an equally good student. Relabel a few thousand states and train before relying on it.
- Ollama Cloud prices depend on the hour (peak 12:00-18:00 UTC on weekdays costs twice off-peak), and its pages do not state concurrency limits for Free and Pro. Run a short pilot at the concurrency you plan to use.
- Agreement in this guide was also measured on 72 states with Qwen3.6-27B. It is a check that the setup works, not evidence that Qwen3.6-27B is a substitute for Qwen3.8-27B.
- Free tiers are not enough for a full run: Vercel AI Gateway's free tier allowed 5 requests per minute on Qwen3.6-27B (54,325 requests would take about 7.5 days), and OpenRouter's free variant allows 50 to 1,000 requests a day.
- Hosted answers at temperature 0 are not guaranteed to be deterministic across providers or over time, so a rerun can differ in a few labels.
- Logprobs, which would allow soft labels instead of hard ones, are listed on OpenRouter for Alibaba, Parasail, Novita, and Cerebras, not for DeepInfra. `gen-data` does not request them; the published run had none.
