# Evaluate

This guide describes the protocol behind the numbers in [results.md](../results.md) and how to reproduce each one. The current numbers are kept in `results.md`; the chronological lab notebook is [model_evaluation.md](../model_evaluation.md).

## The protocol

All ladder evaluations use the `features` encoder and forbid lookahead. The evaluation protocol runs 10 games on seeds 100-109 at 1x speed with a 5-minute cap per game (`--max-seconds 300`, because the runner default is 180 seconds) under the `realtime` clock. Run the protocol with the headless runner:

```bash
npm run headless -- --policy <name> --games 10 --seed 100 --max-seconds 300
```

The headless runner reads `.env`. It writes decision logs to `runs/<tag>/decisions.jsonl` (one record per decision) and game summaries to `runs/<tag>/summary.json`. The runner prints per-game lines and an overall JSON line with `meanPellets`, `meanScore`, `meanSeconds`, `meanLatencyP50`, and `staleRate`.

## Seeds

Seed ranges are strictly disjoint across tasks:
- Evaluation: seeds 100-199
- Validation: seeds 900-999
- Training: seeds 1000 and up

Game `i` uses seed `seed + i`. The data generator `scripts/gen_teacher_data.ts` (`npm run gen-data`) refuses evaluation seeds 100-199. Evaluation seeds never produce training data. Players are deterministic for a given seed, so the same player and seeds visit identical game states regardless of the labeler.

## Clocks

The headless runner supports two clocks via the `--clock` flag:
- `realtime` (default in the headless runner, and how the browser plays): each decision's measured latency turns into game ticks that pass before the answer applies. A slow answer can arrive after Pac-Man has passed the junction ("stale"). The realtime clock charges latency, so slower players (such as the chat models at 187-267 ms) are handicapped against faster ones.
- `lockstep` (`--clock lockstep`): the game waits for every answer. This mode measures decision quality without latency.

Lockstep numbers are not comparable with realtime numbers. Lockstep rows are reported separately.

## The lookahead rule

Lookahead (engine rollouts) may label training data but never goes into a player's input in a comparison. Players are compared on the same current-state input (`features`). An exact rollout of a deterministic engine is close to seeing the future (only frightened ghosts turn at random).

Lookahead is allowed for labeling training data (the teacher `teacher-peek5s` sees rollouts from `src/agent/oracle.ts` while it labels) and for storing rollouts in datasets (`features-peek5s` stored via `--also-encode`).

Results with lookahead in the input are records, not ladder rows. That covers Qwen3.8-27B with lookahead (section 13), Jev and `tev1:4b` with `features-peek5s` (section 16), and student B `pacman-0.8b-qwen-peek` (section 18). Their numbers are under "Records with lookahead in the input" in [results.md](../results.md). The rollout search `oracle-5s` also sees the future at decision time; it is covered in the FAQ at the end of results.md.

## Variance

Realtime results of the same model varied by up to about 150 pellets between 10-game runs (section 18). For example, `pacman-0.8b-qwen` scored 441, 467, and 366 pellets across three runs.

The 2026-10-01 runs shared the Mac with heavy unrelated CPU load (load average 15-36). For those benchmarks, the models compared were alternated to face the same conditions. Compare realtime numbers within one day's runs, not across days. Alternate the models you compare in the same session.

One 10-game run is a single sample. Single games spread widely; for example, Jev's 10 games ranged from 103 to 231 pellets.

Exact repeated requests hit a cache and return 5-10x faster. Latency claims must come from fresh states.

## Reproduce each ladder row

Requirements: Node 20+ with npm, and Ollama 0.35+ for decision models. The published numbers come from an Apple M3 Ultra with Ollama 0.35.0 for local models; Jev ran over the internet.

Every ladder run uses 10 games on seeds 100-109, 1x speed, a 5-minute cap (`--max-seconds 300`), and the realtime clock.

### Lockstep rows

These are listed apart from the ladder because the game waits for each answer. The Qwen rows were 3 games on seeds 100-102. The teacher ran on an RTX 5090, reached over the local network.

| Player | Command | Prerequisite |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.8-27B, thinking off | `npm run headless -- --policy teacher --games 3 --seed 100 --max-seconds 300 --clock lockstep` | Set `TEACHER_BASE_URL` and `TEACHER_MODEL` in `.env` (OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint) |
| Qwen3.8-27B, thinking on | `npm run headless -- --policy teacher-think --games 3 --seed 100 --max-seconds 300 --clock lockstep` | Set `TEACHER_BASE_URL` and `TEACHER_MODEL` in `.env` (OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint) |
| `pacman-0.8b-qwen` | `npm run headless -- --policy pacman-0.8b-qwen --games 10 --seed 100 --max-seconds 300 --clock lockstep` | Download from Hugging Face and import into Ollama ([run-models.md](run-models.md)), or train it ([distill.md](distill.md)) |

## Other measurements

### Offline agreement with the teacher

Script: `training/score_ollama.py` (uses Python standard library only).

```bash
python3 training/score_ollama.py --model <name> --data data/q1/val --target label --n 1000
```

This script measures how often a model picks the teacher's move on held-out validation states. It needs validation data labeled by the teacher with `npm run gen-data`; see [distill.md](distill.md).

Variants:
- Chat models: add `--chat` to ask a plain chat model the way `llm:` does.
- Hosted Jev: `--base-url https://api.typesafe.ai --model jev-latest`, with `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` set.
- Agreement with the `oracle-5s` search's best option (the second agreement table in results.md): leave out `--data` and `--target`. The default `--data data/v1/val` holds validation states labeled by the search, the `gen-data` default labeler.

Agreement is a secondary measure; play in the game carries more weight. Current agreement numbers are in [results.md](../results.md).

### Generality

Script: `scripts/eval_general_decisions.py`.

```bash
python3 scripts/eval_general_decisions.py tev1:4b tev1:0.8b
```

The script downloads public JevBench items at a pinned commit into `data/jevbench/`, verifies hashes, and evaluates accuracy on non-Pac-Man decisions (support routing, intent, policy checks, severity; items over 4,000 characters skipped). An optional `--out runs/x.jsonl` flag records per-item outputs.

Current numbers, including Jev's published run on the same 194 items, are in [results.md](../results.md).

### Synthetic probe

Script: `scripts/probe_decision_models.py` (uses Python standard library only).

```bash
python3 scripts/probe_decision_models.py tev1:4b
```

It sends 40 synthetic scenarios, each with one clearly correct move. It measures latency, output reliability, and basic judgment. It does not measure how well a model plays (section 4 of [model_evaluation.md](../model_evaluation.md)).

To probe the chat teacher:

```bash
TEACHER_BASE_URL=... TEACHER_MODEL=... python3 scripts/probe_teacher.py nothink
```

### Latency split

Script: `scripts/bench_prefill_decode.py`. Flags: `--rounds` (default 3), `--decode` (default `1 7`), `--concurrency` (default 1), `--out`.

Benchmarking against Ollama:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_prefill_decode.py --backend ollama --model tev1:4b
```

Benchmarking against a llama.cpp server:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_prefill_decode.py --backend llamacpp --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8190 --model tev1-4b
```

The script sends the 20 rendered game prompts in `ios/mac_check/bench_prompts.json` (about 383 tokens each), with a unique tag per request so no prompt cache is reused. The measured split for the M3 Ultra and an RTX 5090 is in [results.md](../results.md) and section 17 of [model_evaluation.md](../model_evaluation.md).

### Hardware notes

Local decision models ran on an Apple M3 Ultra with Ollama 0.35.0. Jev ran over the internet. The teacher model and training ran on one RTX 5090.

## Recording results

When you add a measurement to the repository, record it in [working.md](../working.md) with the model, encoder, and hardware, as [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) asks, and name the clock. In-game results go in [model_evaluation.md](../model_evaluation.md) as a new section; update [results.md](../results.md) when a headline number changes.
