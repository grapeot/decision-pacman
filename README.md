# Decision Pac-Man

A model steers a Pac-Man-style game in the browser in real time at 30 ticks per second, choosing among the legal moves at each junction. The repository compares off-the-shelf models (the decision models Jev and Tev1, and plain chat models answering in constrained JSON) with a 0.8B model distilled from a slow general LLM teacher. It contains the browser game, a headless runner for seeded games, data generation and fine-tuning scripts, evaluation benchmarks, and an iPhone app. The distilled model is [on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/grapeot/decision-pacman-0.8b-GGUF).

## Results

Every player sees the same current-state input (`features`), with no lookahead. Each row is 10 games on evaluation seeds 100-109, at 1x speed with a 5-minute cap, on the realtime clock: a slow answer costs game time, as it does in the browser.

| Player | Mean pellets | Decision p50 |
|---|---|---|
| random | 30 | 0 ms |
| `tev1:0.8b` | 69 | 62 ms |
| `tev1:4b` | 148 | 202 ms |
| Jev 1.13.0 (hosted) | 178 | 115 ms |
| `llm:qwen3.5:4b` | 197 | 267 ms |
| greedy (scripted) | 201 | 0 ms |
| `llm:gemma4:e4b` | 230 | 253 ms |
| `llm:phi4-mini` | 232 | 187 ms |
| `pacman-0.8b-qwen` (0.8B distilled from Qwen3.8-27B; [weights](https://huggingface.co/grapeot/decision-pacman-0.8b-GGUF)) | 425, mean of 3 runs (441, 467, 366) | 55 ms |

Lockstep results are listed apart, because there the game waits for each answer and the numbers are not comparable with the ladder: Qwen3.8-27B scored 301 pellets with thinking off and 531 with thinking on (decision p50 2.4 s), both over 3 games on seeds 100-102; `pacman-0.8b-qwen` scored 417 over seeds 100-109.

Full numbers, caveats (clock effects, run-to-run variance up to ~150 pellets, hardware), and the lookahead rule are in [docs/results.md](docs/results.md).

## What we found

- A 0.8B model (LoRA on the Qwen3.5-0.8B base) distilled from Qwen3.8-27B averaged 425 pellets (3-run mean) at 55 ms per decision, against 69 for the same-size off-the-shelf `tev1:0.8b` and 178 for Jev. The teacher chose each move while seeing a simulated 5-second future per option, but only while labeling the training data; the student reads only the current state.
- Stock small chat models with constrained JSON (`llm:phi4-mini` 232, `llm:gemma4:e4b` 230, `llm:qwen3.5:4b` 197) matched or beat the decision models `tev1:4b` (148) and Jev (178) from the same facts.
- Specialization cost generality: on 194 JevBench items, `pacman-0.8b-qwen` scored 0.53 accuracy against 0.66 for `tev1:0.8b` (chance 0.32).
- Decisions are prefill-bound (`docs/model_evaluation.md` section 17): decision models read the answer directly from option logits, whereas chat models writing ~6-token JSON pay about 72 ms more on an Apple M3 Ultra and 27 ms on an RTX 5090.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Node 20+, Ollama 0.35+.

```bash
ollama pull tev1:4b
npm install
npm run dev            # open http://localhost:5173
```

Switch models, encoders, and speed in the side panel, or pass URL parameters such as `?model=tev1:4b`.

To play the distilled 0.8B, download it from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/grapeot/decision-pacman-0.8b-GGUF) and import it into Ollama. No GPU is needed; the `hf` command comes with `huggingface_hub` (`pip install -U huggingface_hub`).

```bash
hf download grapeot/decision-pacman-0.8b-GGUF pacman-0.8b-qwen-Q8_0.gguf Modelfile.pacman-0.8b-qwen --local-dir .
ollama create pacman-0.8b-qwen -f Modelfile.pacman-0.8b-qwen
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173/?model=pacman-0.8b-qwen`. The GGUF (Q8_0, 795 MB) is the evaluated model, and the Modelfile carries the system prompt it was trained under. Ollama copies the weights into its own store, so the downloaded files can be deleted afterwards.

## iPhone

`ios/` runs the same game on an iPhone with three players: the distilled 0.8B and phi4-mini on device, and Jev in the cloud. See [docs/guides/iphone.md](docs/guides/iphone.md).

[`docs/media/iphone_pacman_08b_qwen.mp4`](docs/media/iphone_pacman_08b_qwen.mp4) is a 29-second screen recording of the distilled `pacman-0.8b-qwen` on an iPhone 16 Pro Max at 1x: about 505 ms per decision, 25-28% late answers, no lives lost.

## FAQ

### Why not a hand-written heuristic?

One is on the ladder: the scripted `greedy` rule scored 201 pellets. A much stronger one is possible here because the game has an exact simulator (ghost moves are deterministic except frightened ghosts' random turns). A search that copies the game and rolls the engine forward 5 seconds per option (`oracle-5s`, in `src/agent/oracle.ts`) scores 1,109 pellets per game at about 5 ms of CPU per decision, on the ladder's seeds, clock, and cap. It is not on the ladder because it sees the future at decision time, and lookahead may label training data but never enters a player's input in a comparison. Real tasks rarely have a simulator to search with, so a general LLM teacher is the recipe that transfers. An earlier 0.8B (`pacman-0.8b`) distilled from that search's labels scored at the same level as the LLM-distilled one: 386 pellets (mean of three runs: 456, 300, 400) against 425, a gap smaller than the run-to-run spread of up to about 150 pellets.

The numbers are collected in [docs/results.md](docs/results.md#faq-the-search-oracle-and-the-first-student); details are in [docs/model_evaluation.md](docs/model_evaluation.md), sections 10, 11, and 18.
